# Conbini 🍙 

While it might seem strange, what I appreciate most about Japan is their convenience stores, known as "conbini." These establishments are not only widespread but consistently maintain a standard of cleanliness and offer a variety of affordable and delicious food options. Inspired by this, I developed an e-commerce platform that enables individuals outside of Japan to enjoy the conbini experience online. 

Customers can:
- 🔍 search for a product and/or filter by category 
- 🛒 add products to their cart and update or remove an item 
- 💵 enter their shipping, billing, and payment information at checkout and see a summary of their order upon purchase 

Staff can:
- 📝 search orders by ID, customer name, order date, shipping address, and/or status
- 🚚 view orders and update the status of an order
- 🍵 search products by ID, product name, and/or category 
- ➕ add a new product and determine a main image 
- 👀 view all products including their inventory count and quantity sold
- ✏️ edit or delete a product

In this project I:
- Developed a robust e-commerce platform using Django, Python, and JavaScript, including client and staff-side interfaces
- Implemented AJAX for seamless and dynamic content updates, improving site responsiveness and page load times 
- Created and maintained database schemas for products and orders, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval
- Employed session to store products in a virtual cart
- Utilized Bootstrap's modal functionality to enhance user experience when submitting forms
